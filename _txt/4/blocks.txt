[help_epgdur__epg]
Columns for duration – valid and invalid*
<p>Duration of the program can be set manually, e.g. <i>at the beginning</i> it is common to set the <i>planned</i>
duration for the program (for example, 25:00 minutes).
Also, Prodesk tries to calculate the <i>real</i> duration (based on the duration of all of the program elements),
which can differ from the planned (let's say, it didn't turn out 25:00 but 26:18). <br>
In that case we have two durations (planned and calculated).
When the program is <i>finished</i> (when the editor marks it as READY, and the green check mark appears before the title)
then the calculated duration will get precedence, but up to that point the planned duration is the valid one.<br>
If you want to delete the planned duration even before that, while it is still valid, you can do that by shortcut-link
on the label for currently valid duration.</p>
<p>Valid duration is displayed at the left column, and invalid is in the right one.</p>
<p>Planned duration is colored in dark-green, and calculated duration is in light-green.</p>

Columns for duration – valid and invalid*
<p>Duration of the story can be set manually, e.g. <i>at the beginning</i> editor commonly sets the <i>planned</i>
duration for the specific story (for example, 01:30 minute).
Also, Prodesk tries to calculate the <i>real</i> duration, which can differ from the planned duration
(let's say, it didn't turn out 01:30 but 01:32). <br>
In that case we have two durations (planned and calculated).
When the story is <i>finished</i> (when it gets to the READY phase)
then the calculated duration will get precedence, but up to that point the planned duration is the valid one.<br>
If you want to delete the planned duration even before that, while it is still valid, you can do that by shortcut-link
on the label for currently valid duration.</p>
<p>Valid duration is displayed at the left column, and invalid is in the right one.</p>
